### Instructions

• Need to have at least ***6.2.0 NetLogo*** version intall to run the Project #2.

### Description

❖ This is a model that shows how to divide the world in regions, and keep different turtles confined to the region they start in.<br>
❖ It also shows how each turtle react to different temperatures.<br>

- **agents** are ***BIRDS, HUMANS, BEES, FISH***.
- we have different **environment** different colors.
- For the **interaction**, each agent just moves randomly, then lose energy when they move.

• The world is separated in regions divided by vertical lines.<br>
• When a turtle reaches the left or right boundary of a region, it crosses to the other side.<br>
• Turtles move fast depending on how hot the temperature is or other parameters in the interface.<br>
• Each turtle lose energy when they move so the faster they move the more energy they lose.<br>
• when the turtle run out of energy they die.<br>

**The Buttons**

Choose the **NUMBER-OF-REGIONS**, the **NUMBER-OF-TURTLES-PER-REGION**, the **INITIAL-TURTLE-ENERGY**, and decide how hot you want to make a particular region that you want, click **SETUP**, and then **GO**.

• Press the **SETUP** button.<br>
• Press the **GO** button to begin the simulation and to run forever until the model stop.<br>
• Press the **GO** button again to Pause to the simulation.<br>
• Press the **GO ONCE** button to advance the model by one tick (time step) unlike the Go button that run forever.<br>
• Look at the **Monitor** to see the **death** toll.<br>
• Press the **watch a turtle** button to see the path of that specific turtle until it dies.<br>
• Press the **stop watching** to erase that path created previously.<br>

**Adjusting the slider parameters**
• **INITIAL-TURTLE-ENERGY** the energy of each Agents to start the model.<br>
• **NUMBER-OF-TURTLES-PER-REGION:** The initial number of the turtle population in each region.<br>
• **NUMBER-OF-REGIONS:** the number of regions to look at.<br>
• **REGION#-TEMPERATURE** the temperature of each region.(parameter that the user can set) that will affect how fast the agents move.<br>
• **SUN-BRIGHTNESS:** to set how hot the sun is and make the agents move faster.<br>
• **SHOW-ENERGY?:** Whether or not to show the energy.<br>
